My own implementation of grep.

### Stages of development (not full yet, will be modified later) ###

1. Implement receiving the list of files. Ways of receiving are following: recursive, from dir.
2. Implement filtering the list of files by regexp.
3. Implement output (logging) to console with different modes.
4. Parallel files processing.
5. Web interface.

After each stage add unit tests.
